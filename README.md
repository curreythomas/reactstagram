# REACTSTAGRAM

Started building out a clone of instagram with react native. You will need to have expo xde available to run this as there are no start scripts.

https://expo.io/tools#xde

you can then download the expo app for your iphone or android device as well to see the app on a real device.

If you try to pull down this repo or fork it, you will need to get an access token from instagram to create pull your images into the feed. 

Instructions on getting your access token: https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/

create a .env file after you get your access token and put your token in the file like this:

`INSTAGRAM_TOKEN='{access_token_here}'`
